# Hey there! I'm Ben. :wave:

I'm Ben Soyka, a computer science student at the University of Minnesota and a loving contributor to the world of open-source software. I've started, contributed to, and maintained plenty of projects over the years, notably including a handful of Python libraries.

If you like what I'm doing, want to support my journey, or even rely on some of my software in your own, [I would love your support][sponsor]! :heart:
